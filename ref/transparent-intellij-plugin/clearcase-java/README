The initial version of this project was taken from the net.sourceforge.eclispeccase
project (Clearcase plugin for the eclipse IDE).  It intends to be a Java layer for
accesing clearcase.

On Windows, it does so via the Clearcase Automation Library (CAL) which is a COM DLL
provided with clearcase client installs.  This project only works with the CAL DLLs
provided in Clearcase 4.0 and higher.

On Unix, it does so by sending commands and parsing repolies from the cleartool exectuable.
