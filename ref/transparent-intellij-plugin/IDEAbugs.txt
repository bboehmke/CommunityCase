1) CheckInEnvironment.createDifferencesProviderOn is called with virtualFile null. Why?
   The CheckinEnv. created by LocalVcsServices.createCheckinEnvironment() does not handle null properly.

2) sharemem remote debugging does not work anymore

3) ESC does not close the Check In Project

4) The splitter icon between fields and dual diff tree in the Check In Project is BETWEEN
   the additional fields and the builtin fields (comments)
